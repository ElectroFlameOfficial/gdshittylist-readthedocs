Quick Start Guide
======================

.. attention::

   This is only for those that are in a hurry to start their List. I highly suggest you go into the detailed documentation if you want to understand how the list works.

Welcome to the Quick Start Guide for the geometry dash shitty list. While running the below directions, the following is assumed:

-  You have a host
-  You have all pre-requisites of The Geometry Dash shitty list installed
-  You have all required files installed.

Recreating The Website
------------------------------

.. tip::

   Every time you modify something, you will usually want to refresh once you're done with changing stuff.

**A webserver/host is not required for use, but would be really helpful when asking for support. This helps prevent
a multitude of issues, and this way you won't partially void support for your
recreation if you are not using a Webhost. keep in mind that this only means that very little support will be given.**

You have two options for creating the Website, depending on
how and where you installed the files:

1. :ref:`using-a-webhost` (only available for those who cloned the repo on a webhost and have the files ready.)
2. :ref:`using-a-local-html-file` (think of this like a private website.)

.. _using-a-webhost:

Using a webhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open the index.html file.
2. Look for any instances that represent the shitty list (e.g. Website Name, Submit a record form, etc.) and replace them with your own.
3. State somewhere on the website (preferably under the list editors section) that you are not affiliated to the list in any shape or form.
4. You're done. Just host the website using your own host and you're good to go.

*You can continue to* `Using-a-local-html-file` *or* you can go back to the home page.

.. _using-a-local-html-file:

Using a local html file.

1. Please refer to `using-a-webhost` and follow all steps, disregarding step 4.
